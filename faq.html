                    career prospects in the hospitality industry. Some potential career paths include Hotel operational
                    trainee or as individual department employee, Management trainee and as On the job trainee. If the
                    student's communication and quantum of technical knowledge and skill is commendable, then the hotels
                    can absorb the student as a team leader in any one of the 4 major departments whichever the student
                    specializes.

                    With a hotel management background, the student could specialize in event planning and coordination,
                    organizing conferences, weddings, meetings, and other special events within hotels or event
                    management companies.

                    The student would focus on promoting the hotel's services, attracting new customers, managing client
                    relationships, developing marketing strategies, and driving revenue through sales efforts.

                    The student could become a revenue manager and would analyze market trends, set pricing strategies,
                    manage inventory and distribution channels, and optimize revenue for the hotel by maximizing room
                    rates and occupancy.

                    With experience and expertise in hotel management, the student could work as a consultant, providing
                    advisory services to hotels, resorts, or hospitality organizations, offering guidance on operations,
                    efficiency, profitability, and guest satisfaction.

                    Armed with knowledge of hotel management, the student may consider starting the student's own hotel
                    or hospitality-related businesses, such as a boutique hotel, bed and breakfast, or a specialized
                    service within the industry.

                    These are just a few examples of the career prospects available after completing a hotel management
                    course. The hospitality industry offers diverse opportunities for growth, and with experience and
                    continuous learning, the student can progress into higher-level management positions or explore
                    other areas of the industry
